!petboss (nothing/boss name/time) -- You send your pet to fight various bosses in the world for increased gold return!  However, the stronger the boss, the longer your pet may have to wait between boss runs!  Using â€˜!petboss timeâ€™ will allow you to see the time remaining before you can use petboss again!  In order to begin bossing, you must have a pet at level 30.
